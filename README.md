# SandAndSportsTask

Task : Sun & Sand Sports (Android Task)

1. I used the Kotlin Language for this task assignment.
2. I used the MVVM Architecture.
3. I used the Navigation Graph for this Application.
3. I also used some of the Common Base class feature to manage the Application functionality globally.
4. I called the Api  with Pagination (https://randomuser.me/api/?page=1&results=10)
5. I have managed the below Screens:
   A. Splash Screen.
   B. Home Screen (With list of Users and Pagination)
   C. Detail Screen by Clicking the Recycleview Item.
6. I have defined the Two Test Cases file as below:
   A. ExampleInstrumentedTest ->(I learned the Simple Unit test Feature with Junit and run the Validator concept to identify how it will work)
   B. FragmentHomeTest -> (I learned about how to run the Application from Test Cases, After that waiting for some moments about api is being called
                           once api called we are calling the next action about click event on given postion of argument and calling the detail page)



Note: Sir, I tested the Test Units in Android Simulator and found it's working but for Android device i faced some Permission level Error code.

Let me know sir if i missed anything in given task i will try to accomplish for same.
